# DAO DAO

**NOT PRODUCTION READY**

This builds on [cw3-flex-multisig](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/tree/main/contracts/cw3-flex-multisig) and instead has the voting set maintained by native tokens. This allows for the native tokens to serve as governance tokens in the DAO, similar to how governance tokens work using contracts like [Compound Governance](https://compound.finance/governance).

## Execution Process

First, a voter with an native balance must submit a proposal. The proposer can set an expiration time for the voting process, or it defaults to the limit provided when creating the contract (so proposals can be closed after several days).

Before the proposal has expired, any voter with the required native token can add their vote. Only "Yes" votes are tallied. If enough "Yes" votes were submitted before the proposal expiration date, the status is set to "Passed".

Once a proposal is "Passed", anyone with the correct native token may submit an "Execute" message. This will trigger the proposal to send all stored messages from the proposal and update it's state to "Executed", so it cannot run again. (Note if the execution fails for any reason - out of gas, insufficient funds, etc - the state update will be reverted, and it will remain "Passed", so you can try again).

Once a proposal has expired without passing, anyone can submit a "Close"
message to mark it closed. This has no effect beyond cleaning up the UI/database.

## Complimentary Contracts

These contracts can be used in combination with the cw-dao contract to extend functionality. Simply make a proposal to instantiate them via the cw-dao.

- [cw-vest](https://github.com/ben2x4/cw-vest): Adds the ability to vest cw-20 tokens. Useful if you want community members to be incentivized over a longer term or for payments on projects that have multiple phases.
- [cw3-multisig](../cw3-multisig): Can be used to add SubDAO functionality. Create teams and assign them budgets.

## Testing

You will need Rust 1.58.1+ with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.

You can run unit tests on this via:

`cargo test`

## Security remediation

The v0.0.2 proposal-deposit accounting and legacy-claim quarantine are documented
in [`../../docs/F-ION-1-remediation.md`](../../docs/F-ION-1-remediation.md).
An adminless v0.0.1 contract cannot be changed by merging or uploading this
source; it requires a separate governance and incident-response plan.

## Deploying in production

Once you are happy with the content, you can compile it to wasm via:

```
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/dao.wasm .
ls -l dao.wasm
sha256sum dao.wasm
```

Or for a production-ready (optimized) build, run a build command in the repository root: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus#compiling.

You can then upload the contract code to the blockchain (which only needs to be done once) and instantiate the contract. (Further documentation coming soon).
