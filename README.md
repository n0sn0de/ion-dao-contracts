## Live ION DAO remediation

The reviewed source patch, artifact checksums, exact Osmosis governance message,
funding preflight, and Juno mainnet proof receipts are documented in
[`docs/ION-DAO-GOVERNANCE-PREFLIGHT.md`](docs/ION-DAO-GOVERNANCE-PREFLIGHT.md).
The complete explorer/IPFS-ready expedited proposal package is in
[`governance/ion-dao-remediation/`](governance/ion-dao-remediation/).
The evidence-led DAO DAO successor roadmap, recommended clean configuration,
bounded Juno mainnet proof, and production test plan are in
[`governance/ion-daodao-modernization/`](governance/ion-daodao-modernization/).

The migration quarantines unsafe legacy claims. It does not claim to identify
or repay historical depositors.

## Deploying in a development environment

Build and deploy the contracts to a local chain running in Docker with:

```sh
bash scripts/deploy_local.sh juno10j9gpw9t4jsz47qgnkvl5n3zlm2fz72k67rxsg
```

> Note: This Wasm account is from the [default account](default-account.txt), which you can use for testing (DO NOT store any real funds with this account). You can pass in any wasm account address you want to use.

This will run a chain locally in a docker container, then build and deploy the contracts to that chain.

The script will output something like:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_TOKEN_CODE_ID=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_CONTRACT_CODE_ID=2
NEXT_PUBLIC_MULTISIG_CODE_ID=3
NEXT_PUBLIC_C4_GROUP_CODE_ID=4
NEXT_PUBLIC_STAKE_CW20_CODE_ID=5
NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=juno1wug8sewp6cedgkmrmvhl3lf3tulagm9hnvy8p0rppz9yjw0g4wtqwrw37d
```

You can then instantiate and interact with contracts.

Note, to send commands to the docker container:

```sh
docker exec -i cosmwasm junod status
```

Some commands require a password which defaults to `xxxxxxxxx`. You can use them like so:

```sh
echo xxxxxxxxx | docker exec -i cosmwasm  junod keys show validator -a
```
